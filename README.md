# Self-tuning Network Control Architecture: Results 1

We compare the control costs and performance from run-time greedy actuator selection and full-state feedback with current state information to a random set of design-time actuators and the corresponding fixed full-state feedback.

Dynamics: 50 node randomly generated well-connected ER network (open-loop unstable with eigenvalue magnitude 1.05)

Actuator set subject to cardinality constraint - 5 actuators

Initial state randomly sampled from scaled identity vector

Additive disturbances randomly sampled from zero-mean normal distribution with scaled identity covariance matrix
